Project Description: Advanced Weapon Management System
Overview
The Weapon Management System (WMS) is a comprehensive, secure, and automated platform designed to track, monitor, and manage firearms and other armaments efficiently. Built with modern software architecture, the system ensures full accountability, real-time tracking, and operational readiness for military, law enforcement, and private security organizations.

Key Features
1. Digital Inventory & Tracking
Centralized Database – Maintains detailed records of all weapons, including serial numbers, models, and ownership history.

Barcode/QR/RFID Tagging – Enables quick scanning and identification of weapons in storage or transit.

Real-Time Location Monitoring – GPS and RFID integration for tracking weapon movements.

2. Access Control & Security
Role-Based Permissions – Restricts weapon access to authorized personnel only.

Biometric Authentication – Fingerprint, facial recognition, or smart card verification for secure armory access.

Automated Alerts – Notifications for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity.

3. Maintenance & Compliance
Scheduled Maintenance Tracking – Automated reminders for cleaning, inspection, and repairs.

Digital Logs & Audit Trails – Records all weapon check-ins/check-outs, maintenance history, and user activity.

Regulatory Compliance Reports – Generates documentation for legal and organizational requirements.

4. Advanced Analytics & AI
Predictive Analytics – Forecasts maintenance needs and potential security risks.

Usage Pattern Analysis – Identifies trends in weapon deployment and training needs.

Threat Detection – AI-driven anomaly detection for suspicious behavior.

5. User-Friendly Interface
3D Visualization – Interactive 3D models of weapons for easy identification.

Dashboard & Reporting – Customizable views for administrators, armory staff, and auditors.

Mobile & Desktop Compatibility – Accessible via web and dedicated apps for field operations.

Future Roadmap
